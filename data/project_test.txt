We have isolated the embryonic lethal gene muscleblind (mbl) as a suppressor of the sev-svp2 eye phenotype. Analysis of clones mutant for mbl during eye development shows that it is autonomously required for photoreceptor differentiation. Mutant cells are recruited into developing ommatidia and initiate neural differentiation, but they fail to properly differentiate as photoreceptors. Molecular analysis reveals that the mbl locus is large and complex, giving rise to multiple different proteins with common 5' sequences but different carboxy termini. Mbl proteins are nuclear and share a Cys3His zinc-finger motif which is also found in the TIS11/NUP475/TTP family of proteins and is highly conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates. Functional analysis of mbl, the observation that it also dominantly suppresses the sE-Jun(Asp) gain-of-function phenotype and the phenotypic similarity to mutants in the photoreceptor-specific glass gene suggest that mbl is a general factor required for photoreceptor differentiation.
Tumor cells can evade the immune system through several mechanisms, one of which is to block DC maturation. It has been suggested that signaling via Toll-like receptors (TLR) may be involved in the induction of prophylactic anti-cancer immunity and in the treatment of established tumors. In the present study we found that high numbers of tumor cells interfere with BMDC activation induced by the TLR ligands LPS and poly IC. Tumor cells blocked TLR3- and TLR4-mediated induction of MHCII and the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86, as well as the cytokines IL-12, TNF-alpha and IL-6. Importantly, tumor cells induced inhibitory molecules (B7-DC, B7-H1 and CD80) on spleen DC in vivo and on BMDC, even in the presence of TLR ligands. Moreover, after a long exposure with tumor cells, purified BMDC were unable to respond to a second challenge with TLR ligands. The failure of tumor exposed-BMDC to express co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines in the presence of TLR ligands has implications for the future development of DC-based cancer immune therapies using TLR ligands as adjuvants for the activation of DC.
A number of algorithms have been developed to correct for migration time drift in capillary electrophoresis. Those algorithms require identification of common components in each run. However, not all components may be present or resolved in separations of complex samples, which can confound attempts for alignment. This paper reports the use of fluorescein thiocarbamyl derivatives of amino acids as internal standards for alignment of 3-(2-furoyl)quinoline-2-carboxaldehyde (FQ)-labeled proteins in capillary sieving electrophoresis. The fluorescein thiocarbamyl derivative of aspartic acid migrates before FQ-labeled proteins and the fluorescein thiocarbamyl derivative of arginine migrates after the FQ-labeled proteins. These compounds were used as internal standards to correct for variations in migration time over a two-week period in the separation of a cellular homogenate. The experimental conditions were deliberately manipulated by varying electric field and sample preparation conditions. Three components of the homogenate were used to evaluate the alignment efficiency. Before alignment, the average relative standard deviation in migration time for these components was 13.3%. After alignment, the average relative standard deviation in migration time for these components was reduced to 0.5%.
Changing plasma protein concentrations may affect the protein binding and pharmacokinetics of drugs in the postoperative period. This study examined the effect of postoperative increases (in response to surgery) in plasma alpha1-acid-glycoprotein (AAG) concentrations on the plasma concentrations of the enantiomers of bupivacaine during continuous epidural infusion of racemic bupivacaine for postoperative pain relief.  Six patients scheduled for total hip surgery with combined epidural and general anesthesia received a bolus dose of bupivacaine (65 mg) followed by constant-rate (8 ml/h) epidural infusion of 2.5 mg/ml bupivacaine for 48 h. Total and unbound plasma concentrations of the enantiomers of bupivacaine and plasma AAG concentrations during the 48-h epidural infusion were determined.  Total plasma concentrations of the enantiomers of bupivacaine increased steadily during the infusion (P < 0.0001), whereas unbound concentrations did not change after 12 h (P > 0.1). Total plasma concentrations of S(-)-bupivacaine were higher than those of R(+)-bupivacaine (P < 0.02), whereas unbound concentrations of S(-)-bupivacaine were lower than those of R(+)-bupivacaine (P < 0.002). AAG concentrations initially decreased, but thereafter increased steadily (P < 0.0001). Consequently, free fractions of the enantiomers initially increased and then decreased with time (P = 0.0002). Free fractions of S(-)-bupivacaine were smaller than those of R(+)-bupivacaine (P = 0.0003).  The study confirmed that the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine are enantioselective. During postoperative epidural infusion, changing plasma AAG concentrations affect the protein binding of both enantiomers of bupivacaine. Consequently, total plasma concentrations of the enantiomers increase with time, whereas unbound concentrations reach a plateau.
Insight into the molecular basis of cholecystokinin (CCK) binding to its receptor has come from receptor mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling studies, with both contributing to the current hypothesis that the acidic Tyr-sulfate-27 residue within the peptide is situated adjacent to basic Arg(197) in the second loop of the receptor. Here, we refine our understanding of this region of interaction by examining a structure-activity series of these positions within both ligand and receptor and by performing three-dimensional molecular modeling of key pairs of modified ligand and receptor constructs. The important roles of Arg(197) and Tyr-sulfate-27 were supported by the marked negative impact on binding and biological response with their natural partner molecule when the receptor residue was replaced by acidic Asp or Glu and when the peptide residue was replaced by basic Arg, Lys, p-amino-Phe, p-guanidino-Phe, or p-methylamino-Phe. Complementary ligand-receptor charge-exchange experiments were unable to regain the lost function. This was supported by the molecular modeling, which demonstrated that the charge-reversed double mutants could not form a good interaction without extensive rearrangement of receptor conformation. The models further predicted that R197D and R197E mutations would lead to conformational changes in the extracellular domain, and this was experimentally supported by data showing that these mutations decreased peptide agonist and antagonist binding and increased nonpeptidyl antagonist binding. These receptor constructs also had increased susceptibility to trypsin degradation relative to the wild-type receptor. In contrast, the relatively conservative R197K mutation had modest negative impact on peptide agonist binding, again consistent with the modeling demonstration of loss of a series of stabilizing inter- and intramolecular bonds. The strong correlation between predicted and experimental results support the reported refinement in the three-dimensional structure of the CCK-occupied receptor.
Tumour cell lines derived from breast cancer patients constitute one of the cornerstones of breast cancer research. To characterise breast cancer cell lines at the genetic level, we have developed a full tiling path bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array collection for comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH). This aCGH BAC collection covers 98% of the entire human genome at a resolution of 40-60 kbp. We have used this platform alongside an in-house produced 17 K cDNA microarray set to characterise the genetic and transcriptomic profiles of 24 breast cancer cell lines, as well as cell types derived from non-diseased breast. We demonstrate that breast cancer cell lines have genomic and transcriptomic features that recapitulate those of primary breast cancers and can be reliably subclassified into basal-like and luminal subgroups. By overlaying aCGH and transcriptomic data, we have identified 753 genes whose expression correlate with copy number; this list comprised numerous oncogenes recurrently amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer (e.g., HER2, MYC, CCND1 and AURKA). Finally, we demonstrate that although breast cancer cell lines have genomic features usually found in grade III breast cancers (i.e., gains of 1q, 8q and 20q), basal-like and luminal cell lines are characterised by distinct genomic aberrations.
To determine whether early tonic limb posturing is reliable in lateralizing or localizing of the seizure generator in 14 patients with pharmacoresistent supplementary sensorimotor area (SSMA) seizures.  All patients underwent high-quality MRI scans and stereo-EEG recordings.  The SSMA seizure semiology predicted focal or regional ictal onset in the SSMA in six (43%) patients: Three had a focal SSMA seizure onset, and three had a regional seizure onset with involvement of one SSMA plus adjacent neocortex. The eight remaining patients had diffuse uni- or bilateral seizure onset. Eight of 14 patients underwent a frontal or central cortical resection, but a good outcome was seen in only 3: 2 with no SSMA resection and 1 with an extensive central removal.  SSMA semiology is suggestive of early involvement of this region but is by no means a reliable indicator that the primary SSMA contains the seizure focus.
5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is one of the most common chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, chemoresistance has precluded the use of 5-FU alone in clinical regimens. Combination therapies with 5-FU and other anticancer agents are considered to be a therapeutic option for patients with HCC. We previously reported that the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) can decrease the sensitivity of HCC cells to 5-FU. To overcome this problem, in this study, we elucidated the mechanism underlying EGFRvIII-mediated 5-FU resistance. We observed that EGFRvIII expression can induce miR-520d-3p downregulation and the ensuing upregulation of the transcription factor E2F-1 and the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS), which may lead to drug resistance. Intriguingly, we found that CH12, a monoclonal antibody directed against EGFRvIII, and 5-FU together had an additive antitumor effect on EGFRvIII-positive HCC xenografts and significantly improved survival in all mice with established tumors when compared with either 5-FU or CH12 alone. Mechanistically, compared with 5-FU alone, the combination more noticeably downregulated EGFR phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation as well as the expression of the apoptotic protector Bcl-xL and the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1. Additionally, the combination upregulated the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 in in vivo treatment. More interestingly, CH12 treatment upregulated miR-520-3p and downregulated E2F-1 and TS at the mRNA and protein levels. Collectively, these observations suggest that the combination of 5-FU with mAb CH12 is a potential means of circumventing EGFRvIII-mediated 5-FU resistance in HCC.
Successful trophoblast invasion and transformation of the maternal spiral arteries requires that the pregnant endometrium (i.e., decidua) act in an immunologically paradoxical fashion, accepting the semi-allogenic placenta, while maintaining host defenses against an array of microbial pathogens. In contrast to the growing evidence that the immune surveillance molecules known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are expressed by trophoblasts and fetal membranes, to date, no studies have been conducted on the decidua.  Decidual tissues and cells were obtained from women undergoing first trimester elective terminations or repeat Cesarean sections and analyzed at both the protein and mRNA level.  We now demonstrate for the first time that human decidua differentially express TLRs and their downstream signaling molecules as well as TLR stimulated induction of cytokine production in the first and third trimester of pregnancy.  These findings suggest that the decidua is a critical component of the innate immune response in pregnancy. Moreover, the results have implications for the success or failure of compromised pregnancies in early or late gestation.
Our objectives were to (1) describe the clinical characteristics of and viruses isolated from patients who presented with neurologic symptoms associated with influenza A infection and were hospitalized at Texas Children's Hospital during October and November 2003 and (2) to raise awareness of the neurologic complications of influenza among US children.  We reviewed the medical and laboratory records of all children who were hospitalized with neurologic symptoms and who also had evidence of influenza virus infection by rapid antigen testing or viral isolation.  Eight children aged 5 months to 9 years with neurologic complications associated with influenza A were identified. None of the children had received the influenza vaccine. Four presented with seizures, 3 with mental status changes, and 1 with mutism. All but 1 of the patients had influenza A viral antigen detected in nasal wash samples. Influenza A virus was isolated in culture from nasal wash specimens obtained from 6 of the patients; influenza A virus was also isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of 1 of these patients. None of the patients had serum metabolic abnormalities or other cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities. Three of the patients had brain imaging abnormalities. Five of the patients were treated with antivirals. All 8 of the patients survived, 6 with complete recovery and 2 with sequelae (1 mild and 1 severe).  Neurologic symptoms and sequelae were associated with influenza A virus infection in children during the 2003-2004 influenza season in Houston, Texas. Influenza should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with seizures and mental status changes, especially if they present with respiratory symptoms or during an influenza outbreak.
Apart from assessing the nutrition status, the diagnosis of obesity also includes the assessment of mass and distribution of adipose tissue which provides revealing of latent types of obesity that hold higher health risks. The aim of our study was to assess the nutritional status and to analyze the prevalence of normal weight obesity and abdominal obesity in students from the University of Novi Sad.  The body mass index, waist circumference and body fat mass were assessed in the group of 371 students from the University of Novi Sad (their average age being 22.9 +/- 2.5 y).  One-fifth of the study sample students were found to be overweight and obese, i.e. 21% and 1.1%, respectively. The frequency of overweight and obesity was higher in male respondents (overweight: 41.67% vs. 6.05%; obesity: 1.92% vs. 0.46%). Among the survey respondents, there were 4.6% of underweight students, all of whom were female students. Body fat was found to be increased in 11% of the students, the frequency being higher in the males. The phenomenon of obesity in normal body mass was recorded in 7% of the respondents, being more frequent in female students. The total of 5.6% of female students and 5.8% of male students had abdominal obesity.  The survey results indicate the necessity and obligation to direct attention to regular and complete diagnostics of obesity in order to determine the size of fat body mass and its distribution. The presence of obesity in normal body mass among young, student population requires the comprehensive, detailed and timely diagnosis and treatment of this disease.
Assessing the pharmacodynamics (PD) of a potential therapeutic through the use of a downstream biomarker is essential. This is traditionally performed in the target tissue but limited volume and invasiveness of sampling pose challenges with solid tumours. Currently, there are several small molecule receptor kinase inhibitors and large molecule therapeutic antibodies in clinical trials that interfere with TGFbeta signalling to treat various forms of cancer. With the advent of these new therapies, there is a need for a surrogate tissue that is easily accessible and indicative of tumour response. We propose the use of an ex vivo TGFbeta1 stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) coupled with the measurement of phosphorylated SMAD2 (Sma/Mothers Against dpp, a downstream transcriptional activator) using a sandwich ELISA. TGFbeta is involved in many different cellular responses, such as proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion and immunomodulation. SMAD2 and SMAD3 are phosphorylated as a result of the canonical cascade through ligand binding and receptor kinase activation. These phosphorylated SMADs (pSMAD) associate with SMAD4, a co-SMAD, and transcriptionally activate TGFbeta-mediated genes. This paper describes the novel method for measuring the downstream effects of inhibiting canonical TGFbeta signalling using ex vivo stimulation of surrogate tissue to predict tumour response. In addition, we present the assay validation rationale and data. This novel, validated assay can be used to gain insight into clinical trials regarding TGFbeta signal modulation by multiple inhibitor platforms for both large and small molecules.
Diseases of the liver and biliary tract can be diagnosed and potentially treated by a variety of radiologic modalities and endoscopic techniques. The imaging modalities of ultrasonography, computed tomography, nuclear scintigraphy and magnetic resonance are emphasized in this article. The current status of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, sphincterotomy, biliary endoprostheses, cholangioscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, and laser lithotripsy is discussed.
Of the thirteen active carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes, the transmembrane isoform CA IX has been shown to be linked with carcinogenesis. CA IX presents an ectopic expression in a multitude of carcinomas derived from cervix, uteri, kidney, lung, oesophagus, breast, colon, etc., contrasting with its restricted expression in normal tissues, namely in the epithelia of the gastrointestinal tract. It has been demonstrated that this membrane-bound CA is strongly overexpressed in hypoxic tumors, participating in tumor cell environment acidosis and contributing to malignant progression and poor treatment outcome. Targeting CA IX could thus be an important means of controlling cancer disease. Modulation of extracellular tumor pH via inhibition of CA IX activity represents a promising approach to novel anticancer therapies. Much attention has recently been paid to the CA IX inhibitors drug design, and efforts have been made to obtain isozyme IX inhibitors, with putative applications as antitumor drugs/diagnostic agents. This review will focus on the different CA IX inhibitors described in the literature which could represent excellent potential as candidate therapeutic agents in cancer chemotherapy.
T cells are generally thought to contribute to antimicrobial activity either by releasing lymphokines, which recruit and activate other cell types, or by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted lysis of infected host cells. Recently, it has become apparent that T cells can also mediate antimicrobial activity by direct interaction with microbial targets. Such interactions, which can be either antigen specific or nonspecific, occur in the apparent absence of MHC restriction and do not require the presence of other host cells. Microbial targets recognized by T cells include fungi, parasites and bacteria. Here, Stuart Levitz, Herbert Mathews and Juneann Murphy discuss the direct antimicrobial activity of T cells and speculate on its in vivo relevance.
The human nucleus accumbens (NA) plays an important role in motivation and emotional processes and is involved in some of the most disabling neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The purpose of our study was to check out the potential existence of a statistically significant difference in NA size between parkinsonian and non-parkinsonian individuals, through studying brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs).  For our study we used 52 NAs from 26 cerebral MRIs from neurosurgical patients. Of these MRIs, 15 were preoperative from patients with advanced PD who underwent bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. The group of non-parkinsonian MRIs came from the rest 11 individuals. We measured the absolute and relative NA maximum transverse diameter (D (max)), and absolute and relative NA width at a specific transverse plane.  We found a statistically significant difference of the mean value of the D (max) (absolute and relative) between the two groups. The mean percentage reduction of the NA size was 11.77% represented by the relative D (max).  To our knowledge, this is the first report of parkinsonism-related shrinkage of the human NA. Further research is needed to identify whether a respective shrinkage is also observed in patients with early PD and whether this atrophy is correlated with dopaminergic neuropsychiatric symptoms (perhaps mediated by a malfunctioning NA) that occur in PD.
Adaptive interventions apply a priori decision rules for adjusting treatment services in response to participants' clinical presentation or performance in treatment. This pilot study (n = 30) experimentally examined an adaptive intervention in a misdemeanor drug court. The participants were primarily charged with possession of marijuana (73%) or possession of drug paraphernalia (23%). Results revealed that participants in the adaptive condition had higher graduation rates and required significantly less time to graduate from the program and achieve a final resolution of the case. It took an average of nearly 4 fewer months for participants in the adaptive intervention to resolve their cases compared with those participating in drug court as usual. Participants in the adaptive condition also reported equivalent satisfaction with the program and therapeutic alliances with their counselors. These data suggest that adaptive interventions may enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of drug courts and justify examining adaptive interventions in large-scale drug court studies.
The pathophysiology of tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of acoustic stimulation, is largely unknown, although several lines of research implicate long-term neuroplastic loss of inhibition. The evidence to date suggests that the neuroplastic alterations are likely to be found in multiple brain structures. The present study used manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) to assess the pattern of neural activity in the central auditory pathway of rats with psychophysical evidence of chronic acoustic-exposure-induced tinnitus. Manganese, an activity-dependent paramagnetic contrast agent, accumulates in active neurons through voltage-gated calcium channels, primarily at synapses, and serves as both a structural and functional indicator. Comparison images were obtained from normal subjects exposed to external tinnitus-like sound, and from tinnitus subjects treated with vigabatrin, a GABA agonist shown to eliminate the psychophysical evidence of tinnitus in rats. MEMRI indicated: (1) In rats with evidence of tinnitus, activity was generally elevated in the auditory brainstem, with significant elevation in the cerebellar paraflocculus, the posterior ventral cochlear nucleus, and the inferior colliculus; in general forebrain structures showed decreased activity, although MEMRI may be a less sensitive indicator of forebrain activity than brainstem activity; (2) in normal rats exposed to a tinnitus-like sound, a similar pattern of elevated brainstem activity and decreased forebrain activity was evident, with the notable exception of the paraflocculus, where artificial tinnitus had no effect and (3) vigabatrin, decreased brainstem activity to control levels, in rats with prior evidence of tinnitus, and decreased forebrain activity to below control levels. It was concluded that chronic tinnitus in rats is associated with focal activity elevation in the auditory brainstem and increased activity in the paraflocculus that may be unique to tinnitus.
Paravahlkampfia francinae n. sp., a new species of the free-living amoeba genus Paravahlkampfia, designated as CDC:V595, was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with headache, sore throat, and vomiting, typical symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by Naegleria fowleri. The isolate grew at 33 degrees C, 37 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 42 degrees C and destroyed mammalian cell cultures. However, it did not kill young mice upon intranasal inoculation. P. francinae does not produce flagellates and does not grow on agar plates coated with Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, the usual food source of Paravahlkampfia ustiana, the type species of the genus. The trophozoite at light microscopy exhibited eruptive locomotion and possessed a single vesicular nucleus. Ultrastructurally, the trophozoites had numerous mitochondria with discoidal cristae but did not have a Golgi apparatus. The trophozoites differentiated into cysts after consuming most of the monolayer. The cyst had an inner well-differentiated endocyst and an outer thin, wrinkled, and wavy ectocyst with no pores. During excystation trophozoites ruptured the cyst wall and emerged from the cysts. A unique feature seen in the cysts was the presence of bacterial endosymbionts, both in the endoplasm and within the cyst wall. Full-length sequencing analysis of the 18S and 5.8S RNA genes of P. francinae showed that they were distinct from those of other Paravahlkampfia species. The patient recovered within a few days indicating that some of the previously reported cases of PAM that survived may have been due to P. francinae.
In the United States, New York City has had the greatest number of subjects at risk of AIDS for the longest period of time. This population therefore serves as an indicator of changes in cancer risk which may emerge among persons at risk from AIDS. Using a proportional incidence method, we surveyed cancers occurring among single (a surrogate for homosexual) young men and married young men in Manhattan, the rest of New York City, and the remainder of New York State. The baseline period was established earlier to be 1973-76, during which time no cases of Kaposi's sarcoma were observed among single men in Manhattan. By 1985, the frequency of Kaposi's sarcoma in this group was increased 1,850-fold (compared with expected cases derived from other registries). In the same group, the increase of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was 6.2-fold (p for trend less than 0.0001), with excesses of Burkitt's lymphoma and immunoblastic lymphoma being most noticeable. Diagnoses of Hodgkin's disease increased markedly in 1985 but not earlier. Since this pattern did not follow that of the AIDS epidemic in this area, we suggest that Hodgkin's disease is not an AIDS-associated tumor. Hepatoma was diagnosed more frequently in single young men during the 1980s but similar increases also were observed in married men and thus may be unrelated to AIDS. Thus, only Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma appear to be AIDS-associated tumors, at least so far. With better treatment and longer survival, it remains possible that other tumors will emerge as part of the AIDS epidemic.
Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secreting islet cell tumors of the pancreas are extremely rare. A case of an ACTH producing islet cell tumor with multiple liver metastases is reported and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are described.
The ability to map individual nucleosomes accurately across genomes enables the study of relationships between dynamic changes in nucleosome positioning/occupancy and gene regulation. However, the highly heterogeneous nature of nucleosome densities across genomes and short linker regions pose challenges in mapping nucleosome positions based on high-throughput microarray data of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digested DNA. Previous works rely on additional detrending and careful visual examination to detect low-signal nucleosomes, which may exist in a subpopulation of cells. We propose a non-homogeneous hidden-state model based on first order differences of experimental data along genomic coordinates that bypasses the need for local detrending and can automatically detect nucleosome positions of various occupancy levels. Our proposed approach is applicable to both low and high resolution MNase-Chip and MNase-Seq (high throughput sequencing) data, and is able to map nucleosome-linker boundaries accurately. This automated algorithm is also computationally efficient and only requires a simple preprocessing step. We provide several examples illustrating the pitfalls of existing methods, the difficulties of detrending the observed hybridization signals and demonstrate the advantages of utilizing first order differences in detecting nucleosome occupancies via simulations and case studies involving MNase-Chip and MNase-Seq data of nucleosome occupancy in yeast S. cerevisiae.
The structure of the 30 KDa subunit a of the membrane component (F(0)) of E. coli ATP synthase is investigated in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water, a solvent previously used for solving the structure of another integral membrane protein, subunit c. Near complete backbone chemical shift assignments were made from a set of TROSY experiments including HNCO, HNCA, HN(CA)CB, HN(CO)CACB and 4D HNCOCA and HNCACO. Secondary structure of subunit a was predicted from the backbone chemical shifts using TALOS program. The protein was found to consist of multiple elongated alpha-helical segments. This finding is generally consistent with previous predictions of multiple transmembrane alpha-helices in this polytopic protein.
To evaluate different cut-off temperature levels for a threshold-based prediction of the coagulation zone in magnetic resonance (MR)-guided radiofrequency (RF) ablation of liver tumours.  Temperature-sensitive measurements were acquired during RF ablation of 24 patients with primary (6) and secondary liver lesions (18) using a wide-bore 1.5 T MR sytem and compared with the post-interventional coagulation zone. Temperature measurements using the proton resonance frequency shift method were performed directly subsequent to energy application. The temperature maps were registered on the contrast-enhanced follow-up MR images acquired 4 weeks after treatment. Areas with temperatures above 50°, 55° and 60°C were segmented and compared with the coagulation zones. Sensitivity and positive predictive value were calculated.  No major complications occurred and all tumours were completely treated. No tumour recurrence was observed at the follow-up examination after 4 weeks. Two patients with secondary liver lesions showed local tumour recurrence after 4 and 7 months. The 60°C threshold level achieved the highest positive predictive value (87.7 ± 9.9) and the best prediction of the coagulation zone.  For a threshold-based prediction of the coagulation zone, the 60°C cut-off level achieved the best prediction of the coagulation zone among the tested levels.  • Temperature monitoring can be used to survey MR-guided radiofrequency ablation • The developing ablation zone can be estimated based on post-interventional temperature measurements • A 60°C threshold level can be used to predict the ablation zone • The 50°C and 55°C temperature zones tend to overestimate the ablation zone.
Clinical magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain is typically performed in the standard three orthogonal planes of the magnet, with little regard to head positioning. Multiple sequences with different imaging parameters are performed, and gray-scale images are obtained and displayed separately. The authors have implemented, and currently advocate, the routine acquisition of coregistered transverse images after roll, yaw, and pitch correction to Talairach space. Talairach, anterior commissure (AC)-posterior commissure (PC) referenced, stereotactic space has been widely embraced by the neuroscience community. This standardization should lead to more reproducible and readily interpretable MR examinations. A method is described to obtain direct AC-PC referenced (Talairach space) MR images. Sample protocols are provided. Coregistered T1-weighted, T1-weighted with contrast material administration, T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), MR angiography, fractional anisotropy, and functional MR imaging sequences are presented, depicting a wide range of imaging parameters applied to normal brain anatomy in Talairach space. Illustrative examples of pathology are also provided. Color encoding is discussed and exploited to display and integrate multiparameter MR imaging contrast and white-matter-tract direction (anisotropy). The color composites may reduce the number of images needed for review by a factor of three or four and facilitate interpretation.
Little is known about the arachnoid cyst and there have been few reports of it accompanying psychiatric disturbances. A 57-year-old patient was admitted due to sudden headache, auditory hallucination, and delusion of persecution. An arachnoid cyst was found in the anteromedial aspect of middle cranial fossa on his magnetic resonance image. This was his first psychotic episode and he was also negative to other clinical evaluations including endocrine system. His psychotic symptoms were suspected to be induced by the arachnoid cyst and it was well controlled by low-dose risperidone administration. He left hospital free from psychotic symptoms on 14th hospital day.
Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) is the eighth most common cancer type worldwide with a dismal 5-year survival. Barrett oesophagus, the replacement of the normal squamous epithelia with glandular cells, is the first step in the pathway towards OAC. Although most patients with OAC present de novo, the presence of the easily detectable OAC precursor lesion, Barrett oesophagus, enables the possibility of early detection of high-risk patients who are more likely to progress. Currently, identification of high-risk patients depends on histopathological assessment of dysplasia with no regards to molecular pathogenesis. In the future, screening and risk stratification initiatives for Barrett oesophagus that incorporate molecular profiles might permit improved early diagnosis and intervention strategies with the possibility of preventing OAC. For the majority of patients presenting de novo at an advanced stage, combining so-called -omics datasets with current clinical staging algorithms might enable OACs to be better classified according to distinct molecular programmes, thereby leading to better targeted treatment strategies as well as cancer monitoring regimes. This Review discusses how the latest advances in -omics technologies have improved our understanding of the development and biology of OAC, and how this development might alter patient management in the future.
Foregut endocrine polypeptide-secreting APUD cells (Amine-Precursor-Uptake and Decarboxylation)," in their embryologic migration from neural crest to foregut may become ""arrested"" in the mesoderm or in other ectopic locations. They may become hyperplastic"," adenomatous or malignant. Eight illustrative patients are reported. One patient had ""pancreatic hyperparathyroidism"" with hypercalcemic crises", pancreatic apudocarcinoma, normal parathyroids, biologically active parathormone, but inert immunochemically to the usual parathyroid antisera. Two had gastrin-secreting malignancies in the mesoderm. Remission after excision, but eventual recurrence of the syndrome due to islet cell hyperplasia required total gastrectomy. One patient had a gastric corpus apudocarcinoma found prospectively with hypergastrinemia which required excision of the tumor. One patient had acromegaly with hypergastrinemia and antral gastrinosis treated by pituitary irradiation,  One patient had the antral or intermediary type of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome with moderate hypergastrinemia, duodenal ulcer and antral gastrinosis, treated by vagotomy and antrectomy. One patient had hyperparathyroidism with antral gastrinosis, treated by parathyroidectomy. One patient had malignant Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and developed associated thyroid parafollicular cell hyperplasia and parathyroid chief cell hyperplasia, treated by total gastrectomy and multiple endocrine excisions. These investigative observations demonstrate ectopic loci and associated hyperplasias which support the concept of migration and bizarre potentiality of polypeptide-secreting cells of the foregut.
Age-adjustment of rates is a basic tool for epidemiologists. The methodologies can be classified into direct and indirect types. The direct methods facilitate a valid comparison between populations or across calendar periods. However, they suffer from the problem of instability. By contrast, the indirect methods achieve maximal precision but may sacrifice a valid inter-populational comparison (violating the 'consistency criteria'). In this paper, we propose a new weighting system to summarize the rates. The weighting system is optimal in the sense that it produces age-adjusted rates which are most stable and ensure a valid comparison between populations. The new weighting system calls for an iterative algorithm. However, the procedure simplifies considerably under some conditions. We use real and simulated data to demonstrate the new method.
The p53 tumor suppressor is a key regulator of cell growth and survival upon various forms of cellular stress. p53 is a redox-regulated transcription factor that binds specifically to DNA and activates transcription of target genes. The core domain of p53 holds a zinc atom that protects p53 from oxidation and is critical for DNA binding. A large fraction of human tumors carry p53 mutation, allowing evasion of apoptosis and tumor progression. Restoration of wild type p53 expression triggers rapid elimination of tumors in vivo. This makes mutant p53 an attractive target for novel cancer therapy. Small molecules have been identified that reactivate mutant p53 and induce apoptosis in tumor cells. Interestingly, several of these compounds share the ability to target thiols and affect the redox state of p53, indicating that this is critical for mutant p53 rescue. The identification of a common chemical activity among mutant p53-targeting compounds will facilitate the design of even more potent and selective mutant p53-targeting drugs for improved cancer therapy in the future.
Small-molecule growth factor receptor inhibitors block cell growth in vitro and downstream signaling in vivo, but controlled trials in patients with advanced solid tumors have yielded disappointing response rates. To clarify this discrepancy, we compared the patterns of tyrosine phosphoprotein expression in human cancer cells and primary tumors.  Immunoaffinity chromatography, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting were combined with mass spectrometry to determine the phosphoproteomic signatures of 40 matched normal and malignant tissues from patients with breast or liver cancer. The identities and abundance of the detected tyrosine phosphoproteins were compared with those of ligand-responsive A431 cells.  Patterns of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins are similar among normal tissues of the same origin but vary markedly between different tissues. Primary breast tumors exhibit a strikingly homogeneous tyrosine phosphorylation profile, whereas liver cancers display greater phosphoproteomic diversity. The main breast-tumor-specific tyrosine phosphoproteins are cytoskeletal molecules (actin, tubulin, and vimentin) and molecular chaperones (Hsp70, Hsc71, and Grp75). In contrast, control studies in ligand-stimulated A431 human cancer cells revealed an additional phosphorylated subset of promitogenic phosphoproteins (Grb2, Shc, Jnk2, phospholipase C-gamma, and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase).  Identification of cytoskeletal and stress proteins as the most abundant tyrosine phosphoproteins in breast tumors implicates these molecules, rather than promitogenic effectors, as the prime stoichiometric substrates for kinase-inhibitory anticancer drugs in vivo. Because phosphorylated cytoskeletal proteins and chaperones mediate cell motility and apoptotic resistance, respectively, these data raise the intriguing possibility that small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be of greatest value either as adjuvant antimetastatic/-invasive drugs or as chemo-/radiosensitizers.
The United States spends more on health care than other developed countries, but some argue that US patients do not derive sufficient benefit from this extra spending. We studied whether higher US cancer care costs, compared with those of ten European countries," were ""worth it"" by looking at the survival differences for cancer patients in these countries compared to the relative costs of cancer care. We found that US cancer patients experienced greater survival gains than their European counterparts; even after considering higher US costs", this investment generated $598 billion of additional value for US patients who were diagnosed with cancer between 1983 and 1999. The value of that additional survival gain was highest for prostate cancer patients ($627 billion) and breast cancer patients ($173 billion). These findings do not appear to have been driven solely by earlier diagnosis. Our study suggests that the higher-cost US system of cancer care delivery may be worth it, although further research is required to determine what specific tools or treatments are driving improved cancer survival in the United States.
Three highly homologous wheat germ isolectins (95-97%) are distinct gene products in hexaploid wheat. The amino acid sequences of two of these [wheat germ agglutinin 1 (WGA1) and 2 (WGA2)] are compared with sequence data derived from a complementary DNA (cDNA) clone for the third isolectin (WGA3). This comparison includes three corrections to earlier amino acid sequence data of both WGA1 and WGA2 at positions 109 (from Ser to Phe), 134 (from Gly to Lys), and 150 (from Gly to Trp). These reassignments are based on new results from crystal structure refinement and amino acid sequence data of WGA1, as well as the recently determined nucleotide sequence of WGA3. In addition, the C-terminal residue of WGA1 has been revised to Gly171 and now differs from WGA2 (Ala171). Four other positions, Asn9, Ala53, Gly119, and Ser123, at which WGA1 and WGA2 are identical but differ from the DNA sequence of WGA3, were also reinvestigated by amino acid sequencing techniques and confirmed. Variability among the three isolectins is observed at a total of 10 sequence positions: 9,53,56,59,66,93,109,119,123, and 171. Pairwise comparisons indicate that WGA3 deviates to a much larger extent from WGA1 (at eight positions) and from WGA2 (at seven positions) than the latter from one another (at five positions). Eight of the 10 mutations are equally distributed between domains B and C, the two interior and more highly conserved of the four WGA domains (A, B, C, D). Correlation of the variable residues with the three-dimensional structure indicates that all except the two previously described B-domain residues, 56 and 59 (Wright and Olafsdottir 1986), are easily accommodated at the dimer surface. WGA3 displays a higher degree of inter-domain similarity than found in WGA1 and WGA2. Of the seven variable positions that are located in the domain core (residues 3-31), five are in perfect agreement with our earlier predicted domain ancestor sequence. This suggests that of the three isolectins WGA3 is most closely related to the common ancestral molecule.
Dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) mutations in Pneumocystis jiroveci have been associated epidemiologically with resistance to sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Since P. jiroveci cannot be cultured, inherent drug resistance cannot be measured. This study explores the effects of these mutations in a tractable model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Based on the sequence conservation between the DHPS enzymes of P. jiroveci and S. cerevisiae, together with the structural conservation of the three known DHPS structures, DHPS substitutions commonly observed in P. jiroveci were reverse engineered into the S. cerevisiae DHPS. Those mutations, T(597)A and P(599)S, can occur singly but are most commonly found together and are associated with SMX treatment failure. Mutations encoding the corresponding changes in the S. cerevisiae dhps were made in a yeast centromere vector, p414FYC, which encodes the native yeast DHPS as part of a trifunctional protein that also includes the two enzymes upstream of DHPS in the folic acid synthesis pathway, dihydroneopterin aldolase and 2-amino-4-hydroxymethyl dihydropteridine pyrophosphokinase. A yeast strain with dhps deleted was employed as the host strain, and transformants having DHPS activity were recovered. Mutants having both T(597) and P(599) substitutions had a requirement for p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), consistent with resistance being associated with altered substrate binding. These mutants could be adapted for growth in the absence of PABA, which coincided with increased sulfa drug resistance. Upregulated PABA synthesis was thus implicated as a mechanism for sulfa drug resistance for mutants having two DHPS substitutions.
Insight into the molecular basis of cholecystokinin (CCK) binding to its receptor has come from receptor mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling studies, with both contributing to the current hypothesis that the acidic Tyr-sulfate-27 residue within the peptide is situated adjacent to basic Arg(197) in the second loop of the receptor. Here, we refine our understanding of this region of interaction by examining a structure-activity series of these positions within both ligand and receptor and by performing three-dimensional molecular modeling of key pairs of modified ligand and receptor constructs. The important roles of Arg(197) and Tyr-sulfate-27 were supported by the marked negative impact on binding and biological response with their natural partner molecule when the receptor residue was replaced by acidic Asp or Glu and when the peptide residue was replaced by basic Arg, Lys, p-amino-Phe, p-guanidino-Phe, or p-methylamino-Phe. Complementary ligand-receptor charge-exchange experiments were unable to regain the lost function. This was supported by the molecular modeling, which demonstrated that the charge-reversed double mutants could not form a good interaction without extensive rearrangement of receptor conformation. The models further predicted that R197D and R197E mutations would lead to conformational changes in the extracellular domain, and this was experimentally supported by data showing that these mutations decreased peptide agonist and antagonist binding and increased nonpeptidyl antagonist binding. These receptor constructs also had increased susceptibility to trypsin degradation relative to the wild-type receptor. In contrast, the relatively conservative R197K mutation had modest negative impact on peptide agonist binding, again consistent with the modeling demonstration of loss of a series of stabilizing inter- and intramolecular bonds. The strong correlation between predicted and experimental results support the reported refinement in the three-dimensional structure of the CCK-occupied receptor.
Lipids and cholesterol in particular, have long been associated with breast cancer (BC) onset and progression. However, the causative effects of elevated lipid levels and breast cancer remain largely undisclosed and were the subject of the present study.We took advantage of well-established in vitro and in vivo models of cholesterol enrichment to exploit the mechanism involved in LDL-cholesterol favouring BC growth and invasiveness. We analyzed its effects in models that mimic different BC subtypes and stages.Our data show that LDL-cholesterol (but not HDL-cholesterol) promotes BC cells proliferation, migration and loss of adhesion, hallmarks of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In vivo studies modeling cholesterol levels showed that breast tumors are consistently larger and more proliferative in hypercholesterolemic mice, which also have more frequently lung metastases. Microarray analysis revealed an over expression of intermediates of Akt and ERK pathways suggesting a survival response induced by LDL, confirmed by WB analyses. Gene expression analysis also evidenced an activation of ErbB2 signaling pathway and decreased expression of adhesion molecules (cadherin-related family member3, CD226, Claudin 7 and Ocludin) in the cells exposed to LDL.Together, the present work shows novel mechanistic evidence that high LDL-cholesterol levels promote BC progression. These data provide rationale for the clinical control of cholesterol levels in BC patients.
Many important problems in cell biology require the consideration of dense nonlinear interactions between functional modules. The requirement of computer simulation for the understanding of cellular processes is now widely accepted, and a variety of modelling frameworks have been designed to meet this need. Here, we present a novel public release of the Gene Interaction Network simulation suite (GINsim), a software designed for the qualitative modelling and analysis of regulatory networks. The main functionalities of GINsim are illustrated through the analysis of a logical model for the core network controlling the fission yeast cell cycle. The last public release of GINsim (version 2.3), as well as development versions, can be downloaded from the dedicated website (http://gin.univ-mrs.fr/GINsim/), which further includes a model library, along with detailed tutorial and user manual.
Radiolabelling of leukocytes using labelled phagocytosed technetium-99m (99mTc) colloidal radiopharmaceuticals has been reported as a method for imaging infection. This in vivo study compares the use of leukocytes labelled using 99mTc stannous fluoride colloid with leukocytes labelled using indium-111 (111In) oxinate. A total of 26 patients (10 male, 16 female; mean age 52 years, range 23-88 years) referred for the investigation of possible infection were studied using both leukocyte labelling methods simultaneously. Images were acquired 4h and 24h after re-injection of the labelled cells. The images were evaluated qualitatively by two nuclear medicine physicians. The results show a high degree of concordance between the techniques: 11 of the 28 images showed a focus of leukocyte accumulation with both techniques at 24h, and 13 out of 28 showed a normal appearance at 24h with both methods. In four cases the results were discordant; the 99mTc stannous fluoride colloid labelled leukocytes gave a false positive appearance at 24h in three patients and a false negative in one. In conclusion, colloid labelling of leukocytes offers a sensitive method for the detection of infective foci coupled with the high resolution imaging offered by 99mTc. It has the advantage over other in vitro labelling methods of being a simpler, non-labour-intensive procedure employing whole blood, and its use should be considered by departments that have limited facilities for in vitro leukocyte labelling.
The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also called human herpesvirus 8) has been linked to KS and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) in immunocompromised individuals. We report that PEL cell lines have constitutive active alternative NF-kappa B pathway and demonstrate high-level expression of NF-kappa B2/p100 precursor and its processed subunit p52. To elucidate the mechanism of activation of the alternative NF-kappa B pathway in PEL cells, we have investigated the role of KSHV-encoded viral Fas-associated death domain-like IL- beta 1-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (vFLIP) K13. We demonstrate that stable expression of K13, but not other FLIPs, in a variety of cell lines constitutively up-regulates p100/NF-kappa B2 expression and leads to its processing into the p52 subunit. K13-induced up-regulation and processing of p100 critically depends on the I kappa B kinase (IKK)alpha/IKK1 subunit of the IKK complex, whereas IKK beta/IKK2, receptor-interacting protein, and NF-kappa B-inducing kinase are dispensable for this process. Silencing of endogenous K13 expression by siRNA inhibits p100 processing and cellular proliferation. Our results demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that KSHV vFLIP K13 is required for the growth and proliferation of PEL cells and alternative NF-kappa B pathway plays a key role in this process. Therapeutic agents targeting the alternative NF-kappa B pathway may have a role in the treatment of KSHV-associated lymphomas.
It is unclear whether the increased risk of colon cancer associated with obesity differs for men and women, by distribution of body fat, or by location of the tumor. The primary goal of this study was to address these questions.  Eligible subjects from the Framingham Study cohort were classified according to body mass index (BMI) and waist size during two age periods: 30-54 y (n=3764) and 55-79 y (n=3802). All eligible men and women were cancer-free at baseline and had complete information on the following potential confounders: age, sex, education, height, activity, smoking, and alcohol. There were 157 incident lifetime cases of colon cancer among those followed beginning at 30-54 y of age and 149 lifetime cases among those whose follow up began at 55-79 y. Subjects were stratified further by gender, activity, and tumor location. The Cox Proportional Hazards Models were used to adjust for possible confounding by the above-described factors.  A BMI&>/=30 led to a 50% increased risk (95% CI: 0.92-2.5) of colon cancer among middle-aged (30-54 y) and a 2.4-fold increased risk (95% CI: 1.5-3.9) among older (55-79 y) adults. The BMI effect was stronger for men than for women and for cases occurring in the proximal colon. These adverse effects generally diminished when waist was added to the multivariable models. A larger waist size &>/=99.1 cm (39 in) and 101.6 cm (40 in) for women and men, respectively) was associated with a two-fold increased risk of colon cancer; this risk increased linearly with increasing waist size and was evident for both proximal and distal colon cancer. There was no attenuation of these effects when BMI was added to the multivariable models. A larger waist had a particularly adverse effect among sedentary subjects (relative risk (RR)=4.4 for middle-aged adults; RR=3.0 for older adults).  These findings suggest that waist circumference is a stronger predictor of colon cancer risk than is BMI, and that central obesity is responsible for an increased risk of cancer of both the proximal and distal colon.
Recent research has suggested that the oncomir microRNA 155 (miR-155) is up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, the authors investigated the tumorigenic mechanism of this oncomir in the development of HCC.  Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted to analyze the expressions of miR-155 and its potential target genes in paired tumor tissues and adjacent tumor-free tissues and in disease-free liver tissue samples. The in silico predicted target genes of miR-155 were assessed by dual-luciferase reporting assay, real-time RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses. U6 promoters that drive miR-155 precursor overexpression and miR-155 tough decoy knock-down constructs were used to study its affects on cell proliferation in vitro and on tumor formation in nude mice.  Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated a gradual ascension of miR-155 expression in cirrhotic liver tissues and in HCC tumor tissues compared with low expression levels in normal liver tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-155 in HepG2 cells enhanced its tumorigenesis, whereas depletion of the endogenous miR-155 reversed these tumorigenic properties. Ectopic expression of sex-determining region Y box 6 (SOX6) was able to reverse the growth-promoting property of miR-155. Concordantly, the results demonstrated for the first time that SOX6 is a direct target of miR-155. Further analysis revealed that SOX6 reduced cell growth by up-regulating p21waf1/cip1 expression in a p53-dependent manner. In addition, a decline in p21waf1/cip1 expression caused by miR-155 could be reversed by SOX6 expression.  The current data indicated that SOX6 is a novel target of miR-155 and that miR-155 enhances liver cell tumorigenesis at least in part through the novel miR-155/SOX6/p21waf1/cip1 axis. These findings suggest that miR-155 may be a potential target for HCC treatment.
Y-receptors control energy homeostasis, but the role of Npy6 receptors (Npy6r) is largely unknown. Young Npy6r-deficient (Npy6r(-/-)) mice have reduced body weight, lean mass, and adiposity, while older and high-fat-fed Npy6r(-/-) mice have low lean mass with increased adiposity. Npy6r(-/-) mice showed reduced hypothalamic growth hormone releasing hormone (Ghrh) expression and serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels relative to WT. This is likely due to impaired vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) signaling in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), where we found Npy6r coexpressed in VIP neurons. Peripheral administration of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) increased Fos expression in the SCN, increased energy expenditure, and reduced food intake in WT, but not Npy6r(-/-), mice. Moreover, intraperitoneal (i.p.) PP injection increased hypothalamic Ghrh mRNA expression and serum IGF-1 levels in WT, but not Npy6r(-/-), mice, an effect blocked by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VPAC) receptors antagonism. Thus, PP-initiated signaling through Npy6r in VIP neurons regulates the growth hormone axis and body composition.
Our purpose was, through the comparison of the characteristics of time-intensity curve on triple-phase dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI among groups of giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB), recurrent benign giant cell tumor of bone (RBGCTB), and secondary malignant giant cell tumor of bone (SMGCTB), to find clues to predict the malignant transformation of GCTB.  21 patients diagnosed as GCTB were included in this study. All cases took recurrence after intralesional curettage. 9 cases were confirmed as SMGCTB and 12 cases were confirmed as RBGCTB. Cases were divided into four groups: group A, GCTB (n=9); group B, SMGCTB (n=9); group C, GCTB (n=12); group D, RBGCTB (n=12). Enhancement index(EI) of lesions on DCEMRI was calculated using formula: EI(t)=[S(t)-S(0)]/S(0), where S(0) was signal intensity of lesion on non-contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images and S(t) was signal intensity of lesion on DCEMRI (t=30,60, 180s). Enhancement index of each group in each phase was compared using One-Way ANOVA analysis. Slope values of time-intensity curve were compared by the same way.  Time-intensity curve of SMGCTB was characterized by a steep upward slope followed by an early and rapid washout phase. Time-intensity curve of GCTB and RBGCTB was characterized by a steep slope followed by a relatively slow washout phase. No significant difference in enhancement index was found in the first phase (p>0.05). There was significant difference in the second and the third phase (p<0.05). Enhancement index of group B (SMGCTB) was smaller. There was no difference in rising slope value (p>0.05).  Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI appears a helpful method to find new clues to predict malignant transformation of GCTB.
The author discusses the importance and some of the challenges of conducting qualitative family nursing research in a way that honors the meaning potential of the family. Examples of studies of low income families, families with children with special circumstances, and families with members with cancer are discussed. The use of the arts and humanities to explore the meaning potential of families is also discussed.
Although regulation of chondrogenesis and cartilage development by Wnt signaling is well established, the function of Wnt in the maintenance and destruction of cartilage remains largely unknown. Here we investigated the involvement and regulatory mechanisms of Wnt signaling in cartilage destruction. We found that interleukin-1beta, the primary pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in cartilage destruction, induces expression of Wnt-5a and -7a in primary culture articular chondrocytes. The level of beta-catenin was also increased in chondrocytes of arthritic cartilage, suggesting the association of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling with arthritic cartilage destruction. In addition, our results show that Wnt-7a induces dedifferentiation and inhibits NO-induced apoptosis of primary culture articular chondrocytes. Wnt-7a induces dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes by stimulating transcriptional activity of beta-catenin, whereas NO-induced apoptosis is inhibited via the activation of cell survival signaling, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt, which block apoptotic signaling cascade. Our results collectively suggest that Wnt-7a is associated with cartilage destruction by regulating the maintenance of differentiation status and the apoptosis of articular chondrocytes via different mechanisms.
The proteolytic activity of Furin responsible for processing full length Notch-1 (p300) plays a critical role in Notch signaling. The amplitude and duration of Notch activity can be regulated at various points in the pathway, but there has been no report regarding regulation of the Notch-1-Furin interaction, despite its importance. In the present study, we found that the Notch-1-Furin interaction is regulated by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Src. c-Src and Notch-1 are physically associated, and this association is responsible for Notch-1 processing and activation. We also found that growth factor TGF-α, an EGFR ligand, and PDGF-BB, a PDGFR ligand, induce the Notch-1-Furin interaction mediated by c-Src. Our results support three new and provocative conclusions: (1) The association between Notch-1 and Furin is a well-regulated process; (2) Extracellular growth factor signals regulate this interaction, which is mediated by c-Src; (3) There is cross-talk between the plasma growth factor receptor-c-Src and Notch pathways. Co-localization of Notch-1 and c-Src was confirmed in xenograft tumor tissues and in the tissues of pancreatic cancer patients. Our findings have implications for the mechanism by which the Notch and growth factor receptor-c-Src signaling pathways regulate carcinogenesis and cancer cell growth.
The effect of echoplanar imaging (EPI) acoustic background noise on blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) activations was investigated. Two EPI pulse sequences were compared: (i) conventional EPI with a pulsating sound component of typically 8-10 Hz, which is a potent physiological stimulus, and (ii) the more recently developed continuous-sound EPI, which is perceived as less distractive despite equivalent peak sound pressure levels. Sixteen healthy subjects performed an established demanding visual n-back working memory task. Using an exploratory data analysis technique (tensorial probabilistic independent component analysis; tensor-PICA), we studied the inter-session/within-subject response variability introduced by continuous-sound versus conventional EPI acoustic background noise in addition to temporal and spatial signal characteristics. The analysis revealed a task-related component associated with the established higher-level working memory and motor feedback response network, which exhibited a significant 19% increase in its average effect size for the continuous-sound as opposed to conventional EPI. Stimulus-related lower-level activations, such as primary visual areas, were not modified. EPI acoustic background noise influences much more than the auditory system per se. This analysis provides additional evidence for an enhancement of task-related, extra-auditory BOLD activations by continuous-sound EPI due to less distractive acoustic background gradient noise.
Locus control regions (LCRs) are powerful assemblies of cis elements that organize the actions of cell-type-specific trans-acting factors. A 2.3-kb LCR in the human adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene first intron, which controls expression in thymocytes, is composed of a 200-bp enhancer domain and extended flanking sequences that facilitate activation from within chromatin. Prior analyses have demonstrated that the enhancer contains a 28-bp core region and local adjacent augmentative cis elements. We now show that the core contains a single critical c-Myb binding site. In both transiently cotransfected human cells and stable chromatin-integrated yeast cells, c-Myb strongly transactivated reporter constructs that contained polymerized core sequences. c-Myb protein was strongly evident in T lymphoblasts in which the enhancer was active and was localized within discrete nuclear structures. Fetal murine thymus exhibited a striking concordance of endogenous c-myb expression with that of mouse ADA and human ADA LCR-directed transgene expression. Point mutation of the c-Myb site within the intact 2.3-kb LCR severely attenuated enhancer activity in transfections and LCR activity in transgenic thymocytes. Within the context of a complex enhancer and LCR, c-Myb can act as an organizer of thymocyte-specific gene expression via a single binding site.
Genome-wide analyses such as DNA microarray, RNA sequencing and RNA interference-based high-throughput screening are prevalent to decipher a biological process of interest, and provide a large quantity of data to be processed. An ultimate goal for researchers must be extrapolation of their data to human diseases. We have conducted functional genome-wide screenings to elucidate molecular mechanisms of the inflammation amplifier, a NFκB/STAT3-dependent machinery that potently drives recruitment of immune cells to promote inflammation. Using a public database of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we recently reported the reverse-direction method by which our mass screening data were successfully linked to many human diseases. As an example, the epiregulin-epidermal growth factor receptor pathway was identified as a regulator of the inflammation amplifier, and associated with human diseases by GWAS. In fact, serum epiregulin levels were higher in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders. The reverse-direction method can be a useful tool to narrow mass data down to focus on human disease-related genes.
To assess safety, tolerance and efficacy of liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB) in a large unselected series of paediatric cancer/haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients requiring LAMB therapy.  The study included 84 children and adolescents (median age: 11 years) who received 141 consecutive courses of LAMB for prophylaxis (32), empirical therapy (83), possible (19) or probable/proven (7) invasive infections. LAMB was administered until intolerance or maximum efficacy at dosages individually determined by the responsible physician.  Fifty-nine courses were post-HSCT (42%, 49 allogeneic), and 92 courses were started during granulocytopenia (65%). The median duration of LAMB therapy was 13 days (range 1-79), and the median maximum dosage was 2.8 mg/kg (range 0.93-5.10). Mild-to-moderate adverse events were noted during 109 courses (77%; hepatic, 58.8%; electrolyte wasting, 52.5%; renal, 31.9%; infusion-related reactions, 8.5%); adverse events necessitating discontinuation of LAMB occurred in 6 courses (4.3%; renal, 3; anaphylaxis, 2; hepatic, 1). While median hepatic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and blood urea nitrogen values were slightly (P &lt; 0.01) higher at end of treatment (EOT), bilirubin and creatinine values were not different from baseline. Complete or partial responses were observed in 16/19 and 2/7 courses for possible and probable/proven invasive infections. Thirty-two of 33 courses of prophylaxis and 74 of 83 courses of empirical therapy were completed with success. Overall survival was 90.8% at 3 months post-EOT.  LAMB had acceptable safety and tolerance and was useful in prevention and treatment in unselected, mostly granulocytopenic paediatric patients undergoing treatment for cancer or HSCT.
